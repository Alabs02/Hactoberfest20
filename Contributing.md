<H2>CONTRIBUTION GUIDLINES</h2>

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:<br>

Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.<br>
Make sure your contribution is useful and relevant before submitting. <br>
That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.<br>
Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.<br>
Use the following format: - [Repository Name](link-to-repository-label) _(label: beginner-friendly-label-in-the-repository)_ <br> 
<b>Description</b><br>
Example link formatting: - [awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/labels/good-first-contribution) _(label: good-first-contribution)_ <br> A list of awesome beginners-friendly projects.<br>
Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.<br>
New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.<br>
Check your spelling and grammar.<br>
Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.<br>
The pull request and commit should be given a meaningful title.<br>
Make sure to describe your pull request.<br>
If the label does not clearly state its "beginner friendly" purpose, please make sure to confirm with the maintainer that it is used for such issues. <br>
Please include the link to where maintainer approves it in the PR. See examples below:<br>
Repository called "HornsAndHoovesJs" has label good-first-contribution. <br>
This PR does not need to be confirmed with the maintainer and can be merged straight away.<br>
Repository called "bicycle-wheels-php" has label easy.<br>
This PR must be confirmed with the maintainer of "bicycle-wheels-php".<br>
The issue link where the maintainer confirms that label easy is used in the repository for beginner-friendly tasks has to be provided in the PR description.<br>
Maintainer confirmation is also required in case repository has more than one beginner-friendly-like label (e.g. low-hanging-fruit and up-for-grabs).<br>
The contributed repository must be maintained, have an active community to be able to help newcomers and have issues with an appropriate label.<br>
Links must be pointing directly to the repository, no tracking links allowed. This list is not for advertising purposes.<br>
Thank you for your suggestions!<br>
